**Assignment:Build a simple cyber bookstore interface**

Objective:Create a user-friendly web interface for a cyber-themed bookstore using data from the Google Books API.

APIEndpoint:GoogleBooksAPI

APIDocumentation:GoogleBooksAPIDocs

**Requirements:**

```
Catalog Display:
● Display books from the Google Books API in your catalog.
● Each catalog item should include a book title and display its cover image if available.
● Implement pagination buttons for navigating through the catalog (previous and next).

Page Size Options:
● Provide users with the ability to select the number of items displayed per page.
● Include page size options: 10,25,and 50 items. Page size of 50 is mandatory.
```
```
Bonus Features:
● Deploy your application to ahosting platform of your choice.
● Implement a shopping cart that allows users to select multiple books.
```
**Development Guidelines:**

```
● Prioritize clean and maintainable code.
● Ensure robustness:Write code that is adaptable and robust to easily integrate future features like a search box or a purchase form. Focus on modularity, clear separation of concerns, and scalability.
● Avoid over-engineering; follow the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principle.
● While a fancy UI design is not necessary, ensure that the interface is visually pleasant.
● You are free to use external libraries as needed, but remember that your code should showcase your skills.
```

**Suggested Approach:**

```
Begin by creating a function that interacts with the Google Books API and returns relevant data fields.
Develop a React component that utilizes this function to fetch and render book items. Include an initial state for an empty catalog.
```
**Your task is to build a functional and user-friendly cyber bookstore interface while adhering to these guidelines. Goodluck!**
